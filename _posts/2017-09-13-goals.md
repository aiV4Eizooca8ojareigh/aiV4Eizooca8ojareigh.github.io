I will use this blog as a tool to keep studying mathematics, mostly mathematical physics, probability theory and machine learning.

I do this because I am trying to find the best way to study these areas while I am currently working on an company mostly on machine learning.

I want to have a self-contained set of posts, but that requires a lot of effort in basic ideas. I will write those slowly, meanwhile I will try to use the references I find easy to read, including Wikipedia.

In mathematical physics I am most interested in numerical relativity, quantum field theory and gauge theory.

In probability theory I am interested in stochastic partial differential equations and applications to physics, finance and biology.

In machine learning I still need to find a good criteria to select an area, so I will consider first mostly exploratory expositions.

This is all so far.
